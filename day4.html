    <h1>Question 3</h1>
    <h3>Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping. So you have an array called shoppingList with  all the products you want to buy. Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the products from your list, but you want to add a few more.</br>Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the shoppingList array, and add some new products into it.</h3>

    <h1>Question 5</h1>
    <h3>You are managing a sales department for your company, you want to reward your employees based on
        the sales made by them during the year.</br>
        The criteria is as follows:</br>
        1. Sales from 0-5000 : 2%</br>
        2. Sales from 5001 - 10000 : 5%</br>

    <h1>Question 6</h1>
    <h3>Rewrite the function using '?' or '||'</br>
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.</br>
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
        input/enters an empty line.</br>
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
        handling for a non-numeric input in this task.</h3>
